These exercises helped me to enhance my understanding and apply what I learned in practice.

1. Comments
- Write a simple program that prints "Hello world!" with a comment explaining what the program does.

2. Variables
- Create two variables, one with your name and the other with your age, and print them with an explanatory sentence such as: "My name is [name] and my age is [age] years."

3. Escape Sequences
- Write a program that prints the following sentence using the appropriate escape sequences:
```
He said to me: "Hello! How are you?"
```

4. Strings
- Create a variable with the text "I am learning Python" and print the first and last letters of the text.
- Print the text from the second letter to the fifth letter.

5. Strings Methods
- Convert the text "I am learning Python" to uppercase.
- Remove extra spaces from the text "I am learning Python".

6. Strings Formatting
- Use the old and new method of formatting texts to print the following sentence:
```
My name is [name] and my age is [age] years.
```

7. Numbers & Arithmetic Operators
- Create a program that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides two numbers and prints the results.

8. Lists
- Create a list containing the names of 5 of your friends, then print the second name in the list.
- Add a new name to the list and remove the first name from it.

9. Lists Methods
- Sort the list of your friends' names alphabetically.
- Reverse the order of the list.

10. Tuples
- Create a row containing the names of 3 of your family members, then try changing one of the elements (see what happens).

11. Sets
- Create two sets containing numbers, then print the union of the two sets and the difference between them.

12. Dictionaries
- Create a dictionary containing personal information such as name, age, and city, then print this information.
- Add a new element to the dictionary such as "occupation" and update the value of age.

13. Dictionary Methods
- Use the `get` method to retrieve the value of an element from the dictionary, and specify a default value if the element does not exist.
- Remove an item from the dictionary using `pop`.

14. Comprehensive Training
- Create a simple program to manage the To-Do List using lists. The program should be able to:
- Add a new task.
- View all tasks.
- Delete a specific task.
- Modify an existing task.
